# 🧠 AutoTyper

When **copy–paste does not work** on a website or application, AutoTyper will  
**type the text for you automatically**, just like a real human typing.

Useful for:
- Websites that block copy–paste
- Restricted input fields
- Automation & testing
- Lazy typing 😄

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. You provide the text
2. AutoTyper simulates keyboard input
3. The text is typed wherever your cursor is focused

⚠️ Make sure the correct input field is selected before typing starts.
